## Frameworks

Navigation bar with patient login and doctor login
Doctor login: only use admin as username (so don't have to store username and passwords in the website)
Patient login:
Also, need to have a page to add patients (add this to a database hosted on Google Cloud)
Authentication of login (retrieve information from the database using SQL) from a database hosted on Google Cloud
Based on doctor-assigned exercises, patients can access exercises from the Quest
Within Doctor Page:
Add a tab to add patients and assign them exercises
Add a tab to look at patient data
Add machine learning to this component to see patient progress or some shit
